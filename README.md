# Projects

## Signal Processing Using [<img alt="PACT" width="50px" height="33px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Raspberry_Pi_B%2B_illustration.svg/1200px-Raspberry_Pi_B%2B_illustration.svg.png" />](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)
### Bluetooth Contact-Tracing [VIEW PROJECT](https://github.com/ABanerjee33/BLE-COVIDProximityDetection)
- Used Python and bluetooth libraries to successfully demonstrate the feasibility of Bluetooth Low Energy for
automated proximity-detection for COVID-19 by conducting Raspberry Pi signal experiments 

- Used Matplotlib for data visualization and Numpy & Pandas to parse CSV data and run statistical analysis on key
signal parameters such as RSSI (Recieved Signal Strength) to design a proximity detection algorithm based on
COVID TC4TL (‚ÄúToo close for too long‚Äù) parameters
